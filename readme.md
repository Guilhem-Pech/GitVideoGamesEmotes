# üéÆ Git commit messages Emoji applied to Video-Games ! üéÆ



This chart is greatly inspired  by [dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji](https://github.com/dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji)



## Usage

In general, the rule that is imposed is:

A good commit message should  **let you know what has changed and why** . How those changes has been made does not need to be explained. Reading the code and highlighting changes via a diff is self-explanatory.

However, when browsing a long list of commits you may get lost and not find the changes you want, which is why there are "standards" to know the type of commit this can be text or, in this case, emotes

So this is what the commit message should look like:

```less
 <type emote> <title> [<description (not mandatory)>]

//Exemple
üöë Fix infinite loop
```

It is of course quite possible to 'cumulate' types if your commit falls into several categories.

It is however mandatory to remember that **a commit  should only represent one change.**
